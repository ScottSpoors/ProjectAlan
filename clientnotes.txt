Group Work - 'Alan' Game

Turing Machine parallels:

Machine Head = Alan (Robot)
Tape = Conveyor Belt
Tape 'Squares' = Boxes
State = Alan's Mood
Symbols = Box Colours


Player Objectives:

Player may begin with only 1 or 2 moods, and 2 colours, but unlock more as the
game progresses.

Player goal is not only to appropriately colour the boxes, but to do so in the fewest
steps (and fewest/simplest) instructions possible. 

At the beginning of each 'stage', the player designates the appropriate actions to take
(for each mood) when specific colours are encountered.
E.g;
- Recolour Box
- Swap boxes
- 'Spawn' box
- Do nothing
- Move along

After 'Go' button is pressed, the process begins until success or failure.

Tasks may include... 
- Paint all boxes a specific colour
- Order boxes by colour
- Create a specific pattern



Extras:

- Fail states. (Falling down a trapdoor and being replaced)
- Player's Role/Character?
- Tryannical Overseer with rude dialogue
